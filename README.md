# Tenant-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard
### Project Overview
This Project is aimed at addressing the challenge of tenant retention comprehensively and unlock opportunities for sustainable growth leveraging powerbi to develop a solution.
### Problem Statement
- High tenant churn rate.
- Limited tenant insight to look into tenant satisfaction and concern making it difficult to address issues effecively.
- Inefficient lease renewal.
- Lack of trend identification thereby hindering the development of effective rent strategies. 
### Data Source
Primary
### Tool
- Microsoft Excel was used to store the data.
- Power- Bi was used to outline the entire workflow.
### Methodology
- Data import and transformation.
- Data modelling.
- Measures table.
- Dashboard Visualization.
- Drill through details.
### Insights
- Our Churn Rate Is High (43%): Too many tenants are leaving when their lease ends. This can hurt future occupancy rate if not looked into.
- Tenant Satisfaction is low: Many tenants are not fully happy. This is a major reason people don’t renew their leases.
- Occupancy looks good for now: Occupancy rate at 89% looks good but might drop soon due to high churn rate.
- Some property types perform better: Condos have happier tenants and fewer people leaving. Apartments, on the other hand, have more complaints and more churn.
- Active vs Churned leases Is almost 50/50: We’re losing almost as many tenants as we’re keeping. This means we’re not growing, we’re just replacing losses.
- Rent is increasing , but satisfaction isn’t: Rents are going up, but tenant experience isn’t improving at the same pace. That mismatch can push tenants away.
### Recommendation
- Improve communication with tenants to understand their grieviances.
- Respond faster to maintenance issues.
- Offer small incentives for renewing leases.
- Focus on improving apartment buildings first before renting outing to make customers happy.
- Use data to identify tenants who are likely to leave.
- Make sure rent increases come with visible improvements.
